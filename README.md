# Java Card Deck Simulation

This Java project simulates a deck of playing cards using enums to represent the rank and suit of each card. The program allows for creating a deck, shuffling it, and dealing cards. This is a great example of using object-oriented principles like enums, classes, and methods in Java.

## Features

- **Card Enum**: Represents the rank and suit of a card.
- **Deck Class**: Manages a collection of cards, allows for shuffling and dealing cards.
- **Shuffle and Deal**: Functionality to shuffle the deck and deal cards.

## Project Structure

- `Card.java`: Contains the `Card` enum with two enums—`Rank` and `Suit`—to represent each card's properties.
- `Deck.java`: Manages the deck of cards, including shuffling and dealing methods.
- `Test.java`: A test program that creates and interacts with the `Deck` class to showcase its functionality.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- IDE like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA for development.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseph1435/Card-Deck-Simulation.git
